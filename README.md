Using data over the last 5 years, the project attempts to quantify the impact of 5 factors (Defense EPA/Play, Rush EPA/Play, Receiver Score, Oline Win Rate, and Dline Win Rate) on a quarterback's performance in the NFL. The code measures the impact of the stats, and then analyzes the situations of QBs over the past, whether they underperformed or overperformed (actual vs predicted). Finally, it looks to see which QBs are over-/underperforming their scenarios this year, and which of them have the most favorable/unfavorable scenarios in the NFL.
