Using data over the last 5 years, the project attempts to quantify the impact 5 factors (Defense EPA/Play, Rush EPA/Play, Receiver Score, Oline Win Rate, and Dline Win Rate) have on the impact of a quarterback's performance in the NFL. The code measures the impact of the stats, and then analyses the situations of QB's over the past, whether they underperformed or overperformed (actual vs predicted). Finally, it looks to see which QBs are over-/underperforming their scenarios this year, and which of them has the most favorable/unfavorable scenarios in the NFL.
